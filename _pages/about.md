I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Twente, in the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS), within the Design and Analysis of Communication Systems (DACS) group.

Research Interests
======
- **Network Measurement**
- **Network Security**
- **Sustainable Internet**

My research focuses on analyzing the behavior and performance of Internet systems through empirical network analysis and monitoring. I work on developing practical approaches to enhance network security, including threat detection and traffic behavior understanding. I'm also interested in how we can make networks more energy-efficient and sustainable, particularly in large-scale infrastructures. My goal is to support the development of a safer, more transparent, and environmentally responsible Internet.

Education
------

I hold both a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Naples ‘Federico II’, where I graduated cum laude. My Master's thesis focused on network anomaly detection using big data technologies. In 2023, I completed my Ph.D. at the same institution in 2023 with a thesis titled: "Malicious and Large-Scale Phenomena over the Internet: An Analysis based on DNS", which included a one-year visiting research stay at the University of Twente.
